# Automatic-Protection-of-Clothes-From-Rain-Using-IoT-Mini-Project



Automatic protection of clothes from rain using IoT with Arduino involves integrating various components to create a system that responds to rain conditions. A rain sensor detects the presence of raindrops, triggering the system. An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) measures ambient light to ascertain if it's daytime or nighttime, crucial for determining when to activate the protection mechanism.
Once rain is detected and the system confirms it's daytime, a stepper motor is activated. This motor controls a protective covering mechanism designed to shield clothes from rain. The Arduino serves as the central processing unit, receiving data from sensors and issuing commands to the stepper motor based on predefined conditions.

Components used:Arduino uno, Rain sensor, LDR,Stepper Motor.
